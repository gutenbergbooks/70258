<p class="dropcap">A well known popular Writer
on the History of the Christian
Church has given it as
his Opinion, that whoever
will carefully examine the original Records,
will soon be convinced that the Merits of
<i>Wyclyffe</i>, as a Reformer, have been considerably
exaggerated.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> How far this is
true or not, the Writer of these Pages will
not attempt to determine; but certain it is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
that to “examine the original Records,”
with a View to discover the real Doctrines
and Opinions of <i>Wyclyffe</i>, is much more
easily said than done; and the Reader
who seeks for Satisfaction from the Biographers
of the Reformer, or from the Historians
of the Period, will soon be convinced
that the original Records, and above all,
the still remaining Writings of <i>Wyclyffe</i>
and his Followers, have never been examined
with the Care and Attention necessary
for the Purpose of forming a just
Estimate of his Opinions, and of the Merit
of his Efforts at a Reformation of the
Church.</p>

<p>The List of <i>Wyclyffe’s</i> Writings published<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
by Bishop <i>Bale</i>, in his Work, <i>Scriptorum
Majoris Brytanniæ Catalogus</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, has
been necessarily made the Basis of all that
subsequent Writers have collected. It
has been reprinted, with many useful additions,
by the learned and indefatigable
<i>John Lewis</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, of whose Labours every
Student must speak with Gratitude. Mr.
<i>Baber</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> also has done much towards assisting
future Inquirers, by the very valuable
List of the Reformer’s Writings that he
has compiled. Here, however, we must
stop; Mr. <i>Vaughan’s</i> Compilation<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> has
not added much to our Knowledge of
the Subject, nor can it be commended
either for Accuracy or Learning; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
Mr. <i>Le Bas</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> does not profess to do more
than follow his Predecessors. His humbler
Task, however, has been executed
with great Elegance and Judgment.</p>

<p>The Truth, therefore, is, that until the
Works of <i>Wyclyffe</i>, real and supposititious,
be collected and published, it is vain to
talk of determining his Opinions, or fixing
his real Merits as a Reformer; and it is
with the Hope of directing Attention to
this Subject that the following Tract
is now printed. The learned <i>Henry
Wharton</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was willing to believe that all
the Writings of <i>Wyclyffe</i> might in his
Time have been recovered: “<i>omnia <span class="antiqua">Wiclefi</span>
scripta</i>,” he says, “<i>in Anglia adhuc delitescere,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
et ex Bibliothecis nostris qua publicis
qua privatis in lucem erui posse,
lubenter crederem</i>.” Perhaps we have
still all the MSS. that existed in <i>Wharton’s</i>
Time, and it may be still within our
Power to rescue them from the Oblivion
in which they have so long been suffered
to remain. But the Chances of their Destruction
are every Day becoming greater,
and Delay in such an Enterprize is highly
dangerous. It is true that many of these
Documents will be found dry, and to the
popular Reader uninteresting; buried in
the barbarous Latinity of the Schools, or
concealed under the perhaps still more obsolete
English of the fourteenth Century.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
But they who would engage in such a
Labour as the Publication of the Works
of <i>Wyclyffe</i>, must be above the narrow
Influences of modern Utilitarianism. They
must keep in View a higher Field of Learning
than comes within the Sphere of Mercantile
Speculators in Literature, or Useful
Knowledge Societies. They must feel
that the Value of these Documents as
Compositions, is but a secondary Object
in their Publication; the great End must
be the Discovery of Truth, and the Preservation
of the Remains of an illustrious
Character in our History. What nobler,
what more imperishable Monument could
the Gratitude of England raise to her first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
Reformer, than a complete and uniform
Edition of his extant Writings?</p>

<p>The Editor is fully sensible that the
Tract which is now for the first Time given
to the public, is very far from being a
favorable Specimen of the Works of <i>Wyclyffe</i>.
But it commended itself for Publication
on many Grounds: First, its Shortness.
Secondly, its early Date; for it bears
internal Evidence of having been composed
in the Year 1356<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, and must, therefore, (if
really by <i>Wyclyffe</i>,) have been the earliest
of his Writings. Another Motive for publishing
this Production is furnished by the
Consideration, that, if it be genuine, it
reveals to us a Fact not dwelt upon, so far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
as the Editor knows, by any of the Reformer’s
Biographers; namely, the Connexion
which existed between the earlier
Doctrines of <i>Wyclyffe</i>, and the prophetical
Speculations of the <i>Beguins</i>, circulated
under the Name of the famous Abbot
<i>Joachim</i>.</p>

<p>It remains, however, to be proved, that
the Tract now printed is really <i>Wyclyffe’s</i>;
and this, the Editor admits, seemed to
him an additional Reason for selecting it
for Publication; inasmuch as it served at
once to raise the Question, How far we
have certain Grounds for attributing to
<i>Wyclyffe</i> the Writings that exist under
his Name; nor is it perhaps too much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
to say, that this is a Subject which the
learned World has never been in a Condition
to consider fully. Yet there is no
preliminary Question more deserving of
Attention, if we would form a just Estimate
of our Reformer’s Merits; for
it must be evident to every reflecting
Reader, that if we are in any Degree uncertain
of the Genuineness of such Writings
as are quoted under the Name of
<i>Wyclyffe</i>, the Conclusions drawn from
them, as to the Nature and Character of
his Doctrines, must be in the same Degree
uncertain, and destitute of Authority.</p>

<p>In the present Case, the Grounds upon
which the following Treatise has been assigned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
to <i>Wyclyffe</i>, are no more than
these:—First, that it is found in a MS.
Volume of the fourteenth Century, which
contains several other Tracts, that are believed
to be <i>Wyclyffe’s</i>. Secondly, that
it has been ascribed to <i>Wyclyffe</i>, by Bishop
<i>Bale</i>, Mr. <i>Lewis</i>, and, after them, by his
more modern Biographers.</p>

<p>These Remarks are not made with a
Design to cast any Doubt on the Genuineness
of the following Treatise. It is
very probably by <i>Wyclyffe</i>, although we
have no better Reason than the Authority
of <i>Bale</i> for thinking so. But if any
Reader should entertain a Doubt on this
Subject, deeming the Tract unworthy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
our Reformer, (as many will doubtless feel
it to be very different from what they
would have expected from the Pen of
<i>Wyclyffe</i>,) the Editor must confess himself
unable to satisfy such Scruples; nor is
he aware of any Argument by which the
Authority of <i>Bale</i> and <i>Lewis</i> can be supported.
The Conclusion, however, to
which he desires to bring the Reader, and
for the Sake of which he has hazarded
these Remarks, is simply this, that until
the various Treatises attributed to <i>Wyclyffe</i>
are collected, and rendered accessible to
the Learned, it is vain to think of deciding
the Question how far any given Tract is
worthy or unworthy of his Pen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
One other Particular, concerning the
following Work, remains to be considered.
Mr. <i>Vaughan</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> tells us that “this is one
of the Reformer’s Pieces that is to be
found only in the Library of Trinity
College, Dublin;” and this may, for
aught we know, be true, although perhaps
it only means that no other Copy of
the Tract was elsewhere found by Mr.
<i>Vaughan</i>. Certain, however, it is, that
Bishop <i>Bale</i> has entered the Treatise in
two different Places of his Catalogue, and
under two different Titles; from which
we may infer, that in his Time, or in the
Times of those from whom he copied, the
Tract was found in two different Collections.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
In one place he enters it thus<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>:—(See
No. 84 of <i>Lewis’s</i> Catalogue.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>De simonia sacerdotum</i>, lib. 1. <i>Heu magni
sacerdotes in tenebris.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In another place<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he gives it the Title
under which it is now published, and describes
it thus<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>De ultimâ ætate Ecclesiæ</i>, lib. 1, <i>Sacerdotes,
proh dolor! versantes in vitiis.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>It is by no means improbable, therefore,
that a second Copy of the Tract may still
exist, under some Disguise, in our public
or private Libraries.</p>

<p>The Volume from which the Treatise
is now printed, is preserved among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
MSS. of Archbishop <i>Ussher</i>, in the Library
of the University of <i>Dublin</i>. It
appears to have been once the Property of
Sir <i>Robert Cotton</i>, whose Autograph is
found on the lower Margin of the first
Page, in his usual Form of Signature<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<i>Robert Cotton Bruceus.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">On the upper Margin of the same Page,
in a Hand of the early Part of the sixteenth
Century, now nearly obliterated,
may be traced the Words,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Wiclefe roas a thousand thre hūderyd thre
schorr and uiij.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Over which Sir <i>Robert Cotton</i> has written,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Anno 1368. Wicklif workes to the Duk of
Lancaster.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing appears in the Volume to indicate
the exact Year in which it was
transcribed, but the Hand-writing would
lead us to assign it to the latter End of
the fourteenth or Beginning of the fifteenth
Century. It is imperfect in some
places, but contains a very valuable Collection
of the Tracts of <i>Wyclyffe</i>, for a
complete List of which the Reader is referred
to some Papers that were published
in the Year 1835, in the <i>British Magazine</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>;
where he will also find an Account
of the Treatise, now for the first
time printed, “<span class="gothic">On the last Age of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
Chirche</span>,” with an Exposure of certain
Mistakes that have been committed
respecting it. Several of the Remarks
contained in those Papers have been
transferred to the Notes, which
will be found at the End
of the present
Volume.</p>

<p class="dropcap">How far the foregoing Tract
has suffered from the Carelessness

Object of the following Notes to correct some
of the more obvious Mistakes, as well as to
trace the Historical Origin of the Tract, and
to explain its References and Allusions. The
Editor has not thought it necessary to preserve
in every Instance the Contractions of
the original Manuscript; but he has carefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl"></a>[xl]</span>
retained the Spelling, even in some Cases
where an Error of the Transcriber is evident.

<p>There seems some Error or Omission of the
Transcriber here; but the Allusion is probably
to St. Matt. iv. 9. A learned Friend has
ingeniously suggested to the Editor, that
“nought-having” may mean disregarding,
<i>pro nihilo habentes</i>, not fearing, abhorring,
or thinking any Harm of him that openly
crieth, “all these Things will I give thee, if
thou wilt fall down and worship me;” i. e. not
fearing the Demon of Simony. “Avaunce” is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli"></a>[xli]</span>
perhaps substituted for <i>adoraveris</i>, in order
to render the Passage more applicable to
Clerical Simony, or Purchase of Preferment.</p>

<p>The Exactions of the Court of <i>Rome</i> had
been made the Subject of Legislation in <i>England</i>,
from the 35 of <i>Edw.</i> I., in which Year
(A.D. 1306-7) Petitions were presented to the
King from the Nobility and Commonalty of
the Realm against the intolerable Exactions of
the Pope<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>; (<i>Super variis novis et intollerabilibus
gravaminibus, oppressionibus, injuriis,
et extorsionibus ... auctoritate et mandato
Domini Papæ</i>;) and these Petitions were the
Occasion of a Statute<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, passed at a Parliament
held at <i>Carlisle</i> in that Year, whereby the
Papal Taxation of Abbeys and Religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii"></a>[xlii]</span>
Houses was restrained, and in certain Cases
prohibited. In the Year 1350-1, however,
(25 <i>Edw.</i> III.) only Six Years before the Date
of the Tract before us, the Statute <i>against
Papal Provisions of Benefices</i> was passed<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>,
in which the Pope’s Power of presenting to
Benefices in <i>England</i>, in Violation of the Rights
of the natural Patrons, was restrained, and the
Provisors attached. The Word <i>Reservation</i>
seems to be used in the Text to denote the
<i>Provisions</i> prohibited by these Acts of Parliament;—it
is thus defined by <i>Du Cange</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>:
“<i>Rescriptum seu mandatum summi Pontificis,
quo certorum beneficiorum, cum vacaverint,
collationem sibi reservat faciendam
cui voluerit, aliis legitimis collatoribus exclusis.</i>”
This is exactly what the Statutes
referred to term <i>Provision</i>. The Word <i>Reservation</i>,
however, is used by our modern Law-Authorities<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
in a more general Sense, to denote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii"></a>[xliii]</span>
a Rent or Profit reserved by the Owner of an
Estate or Tenement for his own Use: and in
this Sense the First Fruits or Annates, Tenths,
and Pensions, claimed by the Court of <i>Rome</i>
are rightly termed <i>Reservations</i>, and in their
Origin are clearly Simoniacal: such Pensions,
First Fruits, and Tenths being in fact the
Price paid to the Court of <i>Rome</i> for Collation,
as appears from the Statute 13 <i>Ric.</i> II.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
<i>Stat.</i> 2, c. 2, (A.D. 1389-90,) where after reciting
the Statutes 25 <i>Edw.</i> III. and 35
<i>Edw.</i> I. the Act goes on to complain: <i>Et ja
monstre soit a n̄r. sʳ. le Roi &amp;c.</i> “And now
it is shewed to our Lord the King, in this present
Parliament holden at <i>Westminster</i>, at
the Utas of the Purification of our Lady, ...
by the grievous Complaints of all the Commons
of his Realm, that the Grievances and
Mischiefs aforesaid do daily abound, to the
great Damage and Destruction of all this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv"></a>[xliv]</span>
Realm, more than ever were before, viz. that
now of late our Holy Father the Pope, by
Procurement of Clerks and otherwise, hath
reserved, and doth daily reserve to his Collation,
generally and especially, as well Archbishopricks,
Bishopricks, Abbeys, and Priories,
as all other Dignities, and other Benefices
of <i>England</i>, which be of the Advowry of People
of Holy Church, and doth give the same
as well to Aliens as to Denizens, and taketh of
all such Benefices, the First Fruits, and many
other Profits, and a great Part of the Treasure
of the said Realm is carried away and dispended
out of the said Realm by the Purchasers
of such Graces; and also by such privy
Reservations many Clerks advanced in this
Realm by their true Patrons, which have
peaceably holden their Advancements by long
Time, be suddenly put out: Whereupon, the
said Commons have prayed our said Lord the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv"></a>[xlv]</span>
King, &amp;c.” And again, in Statute 6 <i>Hen.</i> IV.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
(A.D. 1404) cap. 1. <i>Sur la grevouse compleint</i>,
&amp;c. “For the grievous Complaints
made to our Sovereign Lord the King by his
Commons of this Parliament, holden at <i>Coventry</i>,
the vj. Day of October, the vj. Year of
his Reign, of the horrible Mischiefs and damnable
Custom which is introduct of new in the
Court of <i>Rome</i>, that no Parson, Abbot, nor
other, should have Provision of any Archbishoprick
or Bishoprick, which shall be void,
till he hath compounded with the Pope’s
Chamber, to pay great and excessive Sums of
Money, as well for the First Fruits of the
same Archbishoprick or Bishoprick, as for
other less Services in the same Court, and
that the same Sums, or the greater part thereof,
be paid beforehand, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the Exactions of the
Papal Court were attracting great Attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi"></a>[xlvi]</span>
in <i>England</i>, at the Period when this Tract
was written. The Parliament, viewing the
Matter as Politicians, denounced the Papal
Claims on the Grounds that large Sums of
Money were annually sent out of <i>England</i>,
and Aliens advanced to spiritual Livings in
the Church; <i>Wyclyffe</i> taking up the Question
as a Theologian, censures these Exactions
as Simoniacal, and refers to them as symptomatic
of the Approach of <i>Antichrist</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Dismes</i> mentioned in the Text are the
<i>Decimæ Decimarum</i>, or Tenths of all Livings,
which, with the First Fruits, were originally
claimed by the Pope, although subsequently
annexed to the Crown; and which now
form the Foundation of the Fund called <i>Queen
Anne’s Bounty</i>.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Pensions</i> exacted by the Court of
<i>Rome</i> were still more directly Simoniacal:
they are thus alluded to in the Preamble of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvii"></a>[xlvii]</span>
an Act<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> passed in the Reign of King <i>Henry</i>
VIII., where the Commons, addressing the
King, say: “That where your Subjects of
this your Realm, and of other Countries and
Dominions being under your Obeysance, by
many Years past have been, and yet be greatly
decayed and impoverished by such intolerable
Exactions of great Sums of Money as have
been claimed and taken, and yet continually
be claimed to be taken out of this your Realm,
and other your said Countries and Dominions,
by the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, called the Pope, and
the See of <i>Rome</i>, as well in Pensions, Censes,
Peter-pence, Procurations, Fruits, Suits for
Provisions, and Expeditions of Bulls for Archbishopricks
and Bishopricks, &amp;c....
It may, therefore, please your most
noble Majesty, for the Honor of Almighty
God, &amp;c.... That no Person or Persons
of this your Realm, or of any other your Dominions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlviii"></a>[xlviii]</span>
shall from henceforth pay any Pensions,
Censes, Portions, Peter-pence, or any
other Impositions to the Use of the said Bishop,
or of the See of <i>Rome</i>.”</p>

<h3><a href="#Page_xxiv"><span class="smcap">Page</span> xxiv.</a> line 2.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="gothic">smale.</span></p>

<p>This Word in the MS. is written apparently
“samle,” which must be an Error. The Editor
has ventured to adopt a conjectural Emendation,
and print it “smale,” i. e. <i>small</i>.
This, at least, will make Sense; for, the Author’s
Argument is, that if there were nothing
of a Simoniacal Nature in the Reservation of
Benefices, the small Benefices would be as
often made the Subjects of the Papal Provisions
and Reservations, as the “fatte” or more
valuable Livings; but the contrary being the
Case, it follows that the Income of the Benefice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlix"></a>[xlix]</span>
is the real Object, and, therefore, that all
these Exactions of the Court of <i>Rome</i> are Simoniacal
in their Origin.</p>

<h3><a href="#Page_xxiv">Ibid.</a> line 4.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="gothic">Joachur.</span></p>

<p>An evident mistake of the Scribe for <i>Joachim</i>.
In another Place, by a different Error,
we find the Abbot called <i>Joachrin</i>. See
p. xxvi.</p>

<h3><a href="#Page_xxiv">Ibid.</a></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="gothic">In his book of þe seedis of profetis, &amp;c.</span></p>

<p>Whether one Book or more be here referred
to seems doubtful. The Editor is disposed to
think that three different Works are intended;—the
first, <i>Of the Seedis of Profetis</i>; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_l"></a>[l]</span>
second, <i>Of the Seyingis of Popes</i>; and the
third, <i>Of the Chargis of Profetis</i>. In another
Place (p. xxvi) we find <i>Joachim</i> quoted
“in his Book <i>of the Deedis of Profetis</i>;”
and (p. xxix) “<i>Joachim</i> in the Book <i>of the
Seedis of Prophetis</i>.” Again (p. xxx) “the
<i>Bookis</i>” of <i>Joachim</i> are spoken of in the plural
Number, and “the Book <i>Of the Charge
of Prophetis</i>” is quoted, as distinct from the
rest.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Book <i>of the Seedis
of Profetis</i>, and the Book <i>of the Deedis of
Profetis</i>, may be the same; the Word <i>Deedis</i>
or <i>Seedis</i> being one or other of them a Mistake
of the Transcriber. If the Word <i>Seedis</i>
be correct, the Title of the Work was probably
<i>De seminibus prophetarum</i>; unless we
take <i>Seedis</i>, as derived from the Verb <i>to say</i>,
for <i>dicta</i>; for which there seems no Authority,
especially as we find <i>Seyingis</i> used to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_li"></a>[li]</span>
express <i>dicta</i>, in the very Passage before us.
From the other Reading, the Title of the Book
would be <i>De gestis prophetarum</i>. The Book
<i>Of the Seyingis of Popes</i> may, perhaps, be
meant for the <i>Liber de Flore</i> of the Abbot
<i>Joachim</i>, which the Author of his Life<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> tells
us was also called <i>De summis pontificibus</i>.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious, however, that if these
Books contained the Doctrine for which they
are quoted by <i>Wycliffe</i>, (viz. that the Year
1400 was to be the Date of the Revelation of
<i>Antichrist</i>,) they could not have been genuine
Productions of the Abbot <i>Joachim</i>. The
Opinion of <i>Joachim</i> was, that the Year 1256
would be the Era of the total Extinction of
the Christian Church, and that the Triumph
of <i>Antichrist</i> was then to commence, and to
continue for three Years and a half, counting
from the Middle of the Year 1256, to the End
of the year 1260. As in the Lines:—</p>

<p>This Theory was derived from the famous
1260 Days of Prophecy<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, taking Days for
Years, and computing from the Commencement
of the common Christian Era. But
when the Year 1260 passed away and the
Prophecy was not fulfilled, the Followers of
<i>Joachim</i> attempted to correct the Hypothesis
of their Master, and many of them (as for Example
the <i>Beguins</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, who adopted the Speculations
of <i>Peter John de Oliva</i>,) took hold of
the 1335 Days of <i>Daniel</i>, and from them fixed
upon the Year 1335, as the Date of <i>Antichrist’s</i>
Destruction. The Editor has not had
Access to any of the Remains of <i>Peter John’s</i>
Writings, but he is informed by a learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liii"></a>[liii]</span>
Friend, in whose Accuracy he has the fullest
Confidence, that <i>Peter John</i>, in his <i>Tractatus
de Antichristo</i><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, has fixed upon the Year
1356, as the Year of the Revelation, not the
Destruction, of <i>Antichrist</i>, by adding 96, the
supposed Date of the <i>Apocalypse</i>, to 1260.
<i>Joachim</i>, however, in greater Conformity with
Scripture, made the Termination of the 1260
Days, (or Years, as he considered them,) the
Period of the End, not of the Beginning of
<i>Antichrist</i>. Our Author’s Theory<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, supported
by a Cabbalistic Computation from the Letters
of the Alphabet, which the Editor has not
been able to discover elsewhere, makes the
Year 1400 the Era of the Revelation of <i>Antichrist</i>;
and <i>Walter Brute</i><a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, in 1390, appears
to have put forward a Conclusion not very
dissimilar, although maintained on different
Grounds. His Argument was drawn from the
<i>Joachitic</i> Theory of the prophetic Days taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liv"></a>[liv]</span>
for Years, and from the Supposition that the
1335 Days of <i>Daniel</i> commenced at the Desolation
of the Temple under <i>Adrian</i>.</p>

<p>On the whole then it is unquestionable, that
<i>Wycliffe</i> had before him some spurious Productions
of <i>Beguinism</i>, circulated under the
Name of the Abbot <i>Joachim</i>, but which could
not possibly have been derived from the genuine
Writings of that Enthusiast. None of
these spurious Books, so far as the Editor’s limited
Means of Research have enabled him to
ascertain, have been preserved in our Libraries,
or are noticed by the Authors who treat of
the Doctrines of <i>Joachim</i> and his Successors.</p>

<p>It is evident from p. xxxi, that the Tract
before us was composed in or after the Year
1356, the fatal Year of the Revelation of <i>Antichrist</i>,
according to the Followers of <i>Peter
John</i>.</p>

<p>The Passage quoted is taken from the ninetieth
<i>Psalm</i>, as it is numbered in the <i>Latin</i>
Vulgate, (ninety-first in our <i>English</i> Version.)
The Editor is not aware of any Reason why
this <i>Psalm</i> should be referred to as “the seventy
and ninth Chapter,” and he is, therefore,
constrained to assume, that there is here a Mistake
of the Transcriber, who, perhaps, had
before him numeral Letters or Figures, which
he read erroneously. The Words referred to
are to be found in Verses 5 and 6. <i>Non timebis

spreading, that goodly Pair, Peter and Paul,
the Rulers of the Church, being present, set
Matters right again; and on Simon, the supposed
God, attempting a Display, they straightway
laid him dead. Simon, that is, promised
that he should be raised aloft towards Heaven,
and accordingly was borne through the Air
on a Chariot of Dæmons; on which, the
Servants of God falling on their Knees, gave

And thus were they buryed, and none other
wyse, but yf it were so yᵗ they were Men of
grete Estate, so that they were buryed as honestly
as they myght.” And again<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, “And in
this same Yere,” [24 <i>Edw.</i> III.] “and in the
Yere afore, and in the Yere nexte folowynge,
was so grete a Pestylence of Men from the
Eest in to the West, and namely through
Botches, yᵗ they that sekened, as on this Daye,
dyed on the thyrde Daye after, to yᵉ whiche
Men yᵗ so dyed in this Pestylence had but
lytell Respyte of theyr Lyggynge. Than
Pope <i>Clement</i> of his Goodnes and Grace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxiv"></a>[lxxiv]</span>
gave them full Remyssyon and Forgyuenes
of all theyr Synnes that they were shryuen of,
and this Pestylence lasted in <i>London</i> fro Mighelmasse
vnto August nexte followynge, almost
an hole Yere. And in these Dayes was
Deth without Sorowe, Weddynges without
Frendshyp, wylful Penaunce, and Derth without

Cheketethe in ther Heed lesse than they had
afore.”</p>

<p><i>Hollinshed</i> records<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in like Manner the
Fact of the Pestilence, and the Desolation
caused by it throughout <i>Europe</i>. Of <i>London</i>
he says that the Death “had bin so great and
vehement within that Citie, that over and beside
the Bodies buried in other accustomed
burieng Places, (which for their infinit Number
cannot be reduced into Account), there
were buried that Yeare” [viz. 1350] “dailie,
from Candlemasse till Easter, in the Charterhouse
Yard of <i>London</i>, more than two hundred
dead Corpses.” He also notices the Fact
of the Children wanting Teeth, but he makes
the Defect to be four, not two “cheke Teeth,”
as <i>Caxton’s</i> Chronicle stated<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>: “¶ This Yeare
in August died <i>Philip de Valois</i> the French
King. Here is to be noted, that all those
that were borne after the Beginning of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxvi"></a>[lxxvi]</span>
great Mortalitie whereof ye have heard, wanted
foure cheke Teeth (when they came to the
time of Growth) of those 32 which the People
before that Time commonlie vsed to have, so
that they had but 28.”</p>

<p>Our Author, it will be observed, differs from
<i>Hollinshed</i> in making the Defect “eight grete
Teeth,” and in this he has the Authority of
the second Continuator of the Chronicle of
<i>William de Nangis</i>, published by <i>D’Achery</i>
in his <i>Spicilegium</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>; a Narrative which apparently
has been the Source from which many
of our English Chroniclers have borrowed.
It contains a very minute History of this memorable
Pestilence, with several curious Particulars
not mentioned by other Writers. The
Author endeavours to account for the Plague
by supposing the Explosion of a Comet, whose
sudden Evaporation, he suggests, may have
disseminated in the Atmosphere pestilential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxvii"></a>[lxxvii]</span>
Vapours. He tells us also that the Jews were
suspected of having poisoned the Fountains,
and that many of them were in consequence put
to Death, and burnt, in various Places. The
circumstance of the Children born with a
smaller Number of Teeth is thus recorded<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>:—</p>

<p><i>Cessante autem dictâ epidemiâ, pestilentiâ,
et mortalitate, nupserunt viri qui remanserunt
et mulieres ad invicem, conceperunt uxores
residuæ per mundum ultrà modum, nulla sterilis
efficiebatur, sed prægnantes hinc inde
videbantur, et plures geminos pariebant, et
aliquæ tres infantes insimul vivos emittebant;
sed quod ultra modum admirationem
facit, est quod dicti pueri nati post tempus
illud mortalitatis supradictæ, et deinceps,
dum ad ætatem dentium devenerunt, non nisi
viginti dentes vel viginti duos in ore communiter
habuerunt, cum ante dicta tempora homines
de communi cursu triginta duos dentes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxviii"></a>[lxxviii]</span>
sub et supra, simul in mandibulis habuissent.
Quid autem numerus iste dentium in post
natis significet, multum miror, nisi dicatur,
quod per talem et tantam mortalitatem hominum
infinitorum et successionem aliorum et
reliquorum qui remanserant, mundus est quodammodo
renovatus et seculum, ut sic sit
quædam nova ætas; sed proh dolor! ex
hujus renovatione seculi non est mundus propter
hoc in melius commutatus. Nam homines
fuerunt postea magis avari et tenaces, cum
multo plura bona quam antea possiderent;
magis etiam cupidi, et per lites brigas et rixas
atque per placita seipsos conturbantes, nec
per hujusmodi terribilem mortis pestem a Deo
inflictam fuit pax inter Reges et dominos reformata,
quinimo inimici Regis Franciæ ac
etiam guerræ Ecclesiæ fortiores et pejores
quam ante per mare et per terram suscitaverunt,
et mala ampliora ubique pullularunt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxix"></a>[lxxix]</span>
Et quod iterum mirabile fuit; nam cum omnis
abundantia omnium bonorum esset, cuncta
tamen cariora in duplo fuerunt, tam de rebus
utensilibus, quam de victualibus, ac etiam de
mercimoniis et mercenariis et agricolis et
servis, exceptis aliquibus hereditatibus et domibus
quæ superflue remanserant his diebus.
Charitas etiam ab illo tempore refrigescere
cœpit valde, et iniquitas abundavit cum ignorantiis
et peccatis: nam pauci inveniebantur
qui scirent aut vellent in domibus, villis, et
castris, informare pueros in grammaticalibus
rudimentis.</i></p>

<p>The Allusion contained in the Tract before
us to the Circumstance of the Children wanting
Teeth, may possibly be urged as an Objection
to the early Date of 1350, which it
claims for itself. For if this Circumstance of
the Want of Teeth be a Fable, it is not probable
that it could so soon have become current;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxx"></a>[lxxx]</span>
and if on the other hand it be true, it seems
hardly possible that the Fact could have been
ascertained in 1350, respecting all Children
born <i>since</i> the first Pestilence, i. e. since
1348. However, it is possible that by the
<i>first</i> Pestilence our Author may have alluded,
not to that of 1348, but to that of 1340, which
is thus described by Knighton<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, under that
Year: “<i>In æstate scilicet anno gratiæ <span class="allsmcap">M.CCC.XL.</span>,
accidit quædam execrabilis et enormis infirmitas
in <span class="antiqua">Anglia</span> quasi communis, et præcipue in
comitatu <span class="antiqua">Leicestriæ</span>, adeo quod durante passione
homines emiserunt vocem latrabilem ac si
esset latratus canum; et fuit quasi intolerabilis
pœna durante passione. Exinde fuit magna
pestilentia hominum.</i>”</p>

<p>It is no Doubt a Difficulty that the Continuator
of <i>William de Nangis</i> and other Chroniclers,
represent the Phenomenon of the Want
of Teeth as the Consequence of the Pestilence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxi"></a>[lxxxi]</span>
of 1348, but the Story may have originated at
the former Period, although later Writers recorded
it in Connexion with the more recent
and more formidable Pestilence.</p>

<p>The Editor, however, leaves this Question
to be decided by future Research, and by
Judges more competent than himself. It is
not impossible that the whole Passage<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> in which
the Date of “thrittene hundrid yere and sixe
and fifty” has been given, may prove to be a
Quotation from the Book referred to under
the Title of “<i>Joachim</i> in the Book of the
Seedis of Profetis,” and if so, the Tract before
us must of course be the Production of a
later Period.</p>

<p>The last four Verses occur only in the <i>Dublin</i>
MS., and seem to contain an Allusion to the
Prophetical Doctrines of <i>Peter John</i>, or rather
of his Followers. The Date intended is probably
1325, taking “<i>C.ter</i>” for CCC; and that
this Year was one of the Eras fixed by the
<i>Beguins</i> for the Revelation of Antichrist, appears
from the <i>Liber Sententiarum Inquisitionis
Tholosanæ</i>, published by Limborch<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcii"></a>[xcii]</span>
for Example <i>Petrus Moresii</i>, a Beguin, <i>receptus
ad tercium ordinem Sancti Francisci conjugatus</i>,
was examined by the Inquisitors on the
8th of April, 1322, and declares, <i>Credidit et
credebat firmiter, tempore quo captus fuit,
quod Antichristus esset venturus, et consumpmaturus
cursum suum, infra annum quo computabitur
incarnacio Domini <span class="allsmcap">M.CCC.XXV.</span></i></p>

<p>The Verses, as quoted by our Author, are
very corrupt in the Original MS. The Editor
has therefore ventured to alter “<i>viccus</i>” into
“<i>victricia</i>;” “<i>urbis</i>” into “<i>urbs</i>,” and
“<i>tessabit</i>” into “<i>cessabit</i>.”</p>

a Transcript of this Tract, or copious Extracts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xciii"></a>[xciii]</span>
does not seem to have considered it so,

<p>“<i>Elispired</i>, perhaps for <i>expired</i>. <i>Secular
power of the Hooly Goost expired</i>, alluding to
the secular Power the Popes have. For having
quoted four Verses of <i>Sibille</i>, one of which is:

<p><i>Peter Comestor</i>, Chancellor of the Cathedral
of Paris in 1164, and Author of the <i>Historia
Scholastica</i>, is the Person here called <i>Master
of Schools</i>. The Passage referred to occurs in
the <i>Hist. Schol.</i> on the third Book of Kings,
<i>cap. viii.</i> (not <i>cap. v.</i> as quoted by our Author),
and is as follows<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>:—</p>

<p><i>Fabulantur <span class="antiqua">Iudei</span> ad eruderandos lapidei
celerius habuisse <span class="antiqua">Salomonem</span> sanguinem vermiculi
qui <span class="antiqua">Tamir</span> dicitur: quo aspersa marmora
facile secabantur, quem invenit hoc

et inclusus est pullus sub vase vitreo.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcv"></a>[xcv]</span></p>

<p>The same Story with the very same mystical
Application of it which is made by our Author,
is given by <i>Peter Berchorius</i> in his <i>Reductorium
morale</i>, who quotes from <i>Gervase</i> of
<i>Tilbury</i>. This latter Writer, as we learn from
<i>Berchorius</i>, took the Story from <i>Peter Comestor</i>,
and being an Englishman, was most probably
the immediate Source from which the Author
of the Tract before us derived it, especially
as <i>Gervase</i> wrote upwards of a Century before
<i>Berchorius</i>, who died in 1362. The Editor has
not had an Opportunity of consulting the Work
of <i>Gervase</i> of <i>Tilbury</i>, but it is probable that
<i>Berchorius</i> has done little more than extract
his Words.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The same Story occurs in some Copies of
the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i><a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, where the Artifice by
which the Worm “<i>thumare</i>,” (as it is there
called,) was detected, is ascribed to the Emperor
<i>Diocletian</i> of <i>Rome</i>. See <i>Swan’s</i> Translation
of the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, vol. 1. Introd.
p. lxiv.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcviii"></a>[xcviii]</span></p>

<p>The Name of the Worm, to which the marvellous
Property of breaking Stones is ascribed,
is corruptly given by the foregoing Authorities.
It is called by the Jews, not <i>tamir</i>, or
<i>thamus</i>, but <i>schamir</i> (שמיר), and frequent Allusions
to it occur in the Rabbinical Writers.
The original Story is to be found in the <i>Talmud</i>,
and seems intended to explain what we
read 1 Kings, vi. 7, that <i>neither Hammer nor
Axe nor any Tool of Iron</i> was heard in the
Temple of <i>Solomon</i> while it was in building.
The following<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> is an abridged Account of the
original Legend: <i>Solomon</i>, when about to
build the Temple, perceived by his Wisdom,
that it would be more acceptable to <span class="smcap">God</span>, if
built of Stones upon which no Tool of Iron
had ever been raised. Whereupon he inquired
of the Rabbis how this was to be effected.—They
told him that he must procure the Worm
<i>Schamir</i>, by the Help of which <i>Moses</i> had cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcix"></a>[xcix]</span>
the Stones of the High Priest’s Breastplate.
<i>Solomon</i> then inquired where this Worm was
to be found. The Rabbis confessed their Ignorance,
but advised him to summon certain
Devils, and compel them, by Torments, to
make the Discovery; this was done, and the
Devils answered, that <i>Aschmedai</i>, the King of
the Devils, alone, could tell where the Worm
<i>Schamir</i> was to be found. Accordingly, <i>Benaiah</i>,
Son of <i>Jehoiada</i>, was sent with a Chain
on which the Name of <span class="smcap">God</span> was inscribed, to
bind <i>Aschmedai</i>, and bring him before <i>Solomon</i>.
It took some Time to capture <i>Aschmedai</i>, and
a long Account is given of the Difficulties of
the Undertaking. At Length, on the third
Day, he is brought to <i>Solomon</i>, who asks him
for the <i>Schamir</i>. <i>Aschmedai</i> answers, It is
not in my Keeping; but <i>Sara-Dima</i> (the Angel
that presides over the Sea) has it, and he will
entrust it only to the Wild-Hen (תרנגולא),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_c"></a>[c]</span>
from whom he exacts an Oath for its safe Return.
<i>Solomon</i> asked what the Wild-Hen did
with the <i>Schamir</i>; the Dæmon answered, She
brings the Worm to the Rocky Mountains,
destitute of Grass and Verdure, and by its
means she breaks down their Rocks; she then
carries up the Seeds of Trees, and thus the
Mountains, once Barren, become covered with
Woods. Having obtained this Information,
<i>Solomon</i> sought out the Nest of the Wild-Hen,
and enclosed it, with her Young Ones, in a
Covering of transparent Crystal. The Wild-Hen,
on her Return, seeing her Nest and Young
Ones, but finding herself unable to enter it,
flew away, and soon after returned with the
Worm <i>Schamir</i>; whereupon <i>Solomon’s</i> Servants,
who had been lying in Wait for her, set
up a great Shout, which so terrified her, that
she dropped the Worm, and thus <i>Solomon</i> obtained
Possession of it. The Wild-Hen, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ci"></a>[ci]</span>
flew away, and hanged herself, for having
lost the Worm, and broken her Oath. See
<i>Eisenmenger</i>, <i>Entdecktes Judenthum</i> Theil,
I. p. 350. <i>Johan. Christoph. Wagenseilii Sota</i>,
p. 1072, and <i>Buxtorfii Lexicon Chald. et
Talmud.</i> <i>in voce</i> שמיר.</p>

Thus in our <i>English</i> Version of the

<p class="center"><span class="gothic">þe on &amp; twenty Salme. 2i.</span></p>

<p>The Editor is not sure that he has rightly
deciphered the Letters represented by “2i;”
he once thought they were “xi,” but this
seemed inexplicable, and he now believes them
to be an Attempt of a very ignorant Transcriber
to represent in <i>Arabic</i> Numerals the Number
of the Psalm referred to.</p>

<p>This Reference belongs to what goes before,
not to what follows. <i>Mr. Vaughan</i>, in his <i>Life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ciii"></a>[ciii]</span>
of Wycliffe</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, not perceiving this, has altered
the Text to make the Sense perfect, and quotes
the Passage thus: “So, when we were sinful,
and the Children of Wrath, God’s Son came
out of Heaven, and praying His Father for
His Enemies, He died for us. Then much
rather shall we be saved, now we are made
righteous through His Blood. St. Paul
writeth to the <i>Romans</i>, that <i>Jesus</i> should
pray for us, and that He went into Heaven to
appear in the Presence of God for us. The
same also he writeth to the <i>Hebrews</i>, the
which Presence may He grant us to behold,
who liveth and reigneth without End.—Amen.”</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Vaughan</i>, however, does not tell his
Readers what Passage of the Epistle to the
<i>Romans</i>, occurring, also, in the Epistle to the
<i>Hebrews</i>, he supposes our Author to have
quoted. There exists, in Fact, no such Passage;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_civ"></a>[civ]</span>
nor does the Text stand in Need of any
Emendation. The References, in both Cases,
come after the Passages quoted; and this removes
all the Difficulty which Mr. <i>Vaughan</i>
appears to have found in the Reading of the
original Manuscript.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
